                text3: 'Checking the position of the sun in relation to the terrain is also an important point to be observed when choosing the terrain. Depending on the position of the land, the relationship of the house with the sun can be very different. If you want to make a pool in the back, for example, buying a plot of land where you practically never have the sun in the backyard can be a big problem.',
                topic3: 'Locality',
                text4: 'Still talking about structure, it is important to see if there is no spring, river or stream near the land, as the presende of water nearby can completely impact the hardness of the soil. The less resistant to the soil, the more it will be necessary to spend on the foundation structure, which is usually already the moment when a good part of the budget is spent. A useful tip is to talk to neighbors who have already built to find out how the hardness of the soil went, or to find out if even any of them paid to do the soil study.',
